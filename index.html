                <p class="modal-description margin-top-sm">A vinyl fence is a popular and attractive option for
                  homeowners in Florida who are looking for a durable and low-maintenance fencing solution. Made from
                  PVC (polyvinyl chloride), vinyl fences are designed to withstand harsh weather conditions, such as
                  heavy rain, strong winds, and intense sunlight, without fading, warping, or cracking.

                  One of the key advantages of vinyl fences is that they are highly customizable, with a wide range of
                  colors, styles, and textures available to choose from. Whether you prefer a traditional picket fence
                  or a modern privacy fence, you can find a vinyl fence that suits your aesthetic preferences and
                  functional needs.

                  In addition to their versatility and durability, vinyl fences are also easy to clean and maintain.
                  Unlike wood fences that require regular staining or painting, vinyl fences can be cleaned with just
                  soap and water, making them a cost-effective and hassle-free choice for homeowners.

                  If you're looking for a stylish and practical fencing solution for your Florida property, a vinyl
                  fence could be the perfect choice. Contact us today to learn more about our vinyl fencing options and
                  to schedule a consultation with one of our experts.

                <p class="modal-description margin-top-sm">A chain link fence is a popular choice for both residential
                  and commercial properties in Florida. It is a type of fence made of galvanized steel wires woven
                  together to form a diamond-shaped pattern. This type of fence is durable, long-lasting, and provides a
                  clear view of the surrounding area.
                  <br><br>
                  Chain link fences come in various heights and gauges to accommodate different needs and applications.
                  They can be installed with different types of posts and hardware to ensure that they are sturdy and
                  secure. Some chain link fences come with a vinyl coating that provides additional protection against
                  rust, corrosion, and UV rays.
                  <br> <br>
                  Chain link fences are easy to install and maintain, making them a cost-effective choice for many
                  property owners. They are also versatile and can be used for a variety of purposes, including
                  security, privacy, animal containment, and decorative purposes. They are commonly used around swimming
                  pools, sports fields, playgrounds, and construction sites.
                  <br><br>
                  Overall, a chain link fence is a practical and affordable option for property owners in Florida who
                  are looking for a reliable and low-maintenance fencing solution.

                <p class="modal-description margin-top-sm">Aluminum fencing is an excellent choice for both residential
                  and commercial properties in Florida. Made from high-quality aluminum alloy, these fences are
                  lightweight, durable, and require very little maintenance. Here are some key features of aluminum
                  fencing that make it a popular choice for Florida homeowners:

                  Durability: Aluminum fencing is known for its strength and durability, and can withstand harsh weather
                  conditions, such as hurricanes and extreme heat, which are common in Florida.

                  Low maintenance: Unlike wood fencing, which requires regular staining and sealing, aluminum fencing
                  requires minimal maintenance. It is resistant to rust, corrosion, and fading, and can be easily
                  cleaned with soap and water.
                  Customizable: Aluminum fencing comes in a variety of styles and colors, making it easy to match the
                  aesthetics of any property. It can be customized to fit any height or width, making it suitable for
                  any size of property.

                  Security: Aluminum fencing can be installed with locking mechanisms and other security features,
                  making it an ideal choice for commercial properties and high-security areas.

                  Eco-friendly: Aluminum fencing is 100% recyclable, making it an eco-friendly option for those who are
                  concerned about the environment.

                  At YAJU FENCE, we offer a wide range of aluminum fencing options to meet the specific needs of our

                <div class="modal-description">
                  <p>A wood fence is a classic and timeless choice for
                    homeowners
                    looking to add privacy and beauty to their property. Wood fences are available in a variety of
                    styles,
                    such as picket, privacy, and split rail, and can be customized to fit the specific needs of each
                    homeowner. They are constructed of cedar, which is known for their durability and resistance to
                    decay
                    and insects.
                    <br><br>
                    Our specification includes:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>1×6 pickets</li>
                    <li>2×4 rails</li>

                  <br>
                  <p>
                    We build your wood fence from scratch on site. We set every post in concrete so your posts won’t
                    shift
                    or lean. We nail up every board one by one using hot-dipped galvanized ring shank nails that won’t
                    rust or pull apart.  This allows for a custom construction that is stronger than pre-built panels.
                    <br><br>
                    In Florida, wood fences are a popular option due to their ability to withstand the heat and humidity
                    of the state's climate. The natural warmth and beauty of wood also complement the lush foliage and
                    tropical landscapes of Florida. Whether you're looking to add privacy to your backyard or create a
                    boundary around your property, a wood fence is a versatile and attractive choice for any Florida
                    homeowner.
                    <br><br>
                    We offer three traditional wood fencing styles that can be customized to accent your home with a
                    secure perimeter that your neighbors will appreciate as much as you do.
